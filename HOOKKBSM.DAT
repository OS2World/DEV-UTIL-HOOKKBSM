;; HOOKKBSM.DAT Key Assignment file for HOOKKBSM.EXE Thu  10-21-1993
;;
;; This file  MUST be located in the directory c:\os2\hook
;;
;; NB the actuating Key strokes are Shift-Alt-X or Shift-Ctrl-X
;;
;; The Shift is not required in the text below
;;
;; <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< The format is as follows >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
;;
;; A ";"indicates a comment and any text from ";" to end of line is ignored
;;
;; Blank Lines are not allowed - place at least one ";" on any line
;;
;; There must be at least 1 space between each field and the next field.
;;
;; The first field in a line is either A# or C# indicating an assignment to
;; the Shift-Alt-# or Shift-Ctrl-# key where #  is  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 or
;; either Ax or Cx indicating an assignment to Shift-Alt-x or to Shift-Ctrl-x
;; where x is any letter from a .. z.
;; No distinction exists between LowerCase or UpperCase.
;;
;; The next field has the following options.
;;
;; 9 means that the key will not be recognized. This can be accomplishied
;;   as well by commenting that assignment out with ";
;; ;Ad        means that Shift-Alt-D is not assigned
;; Ad 9 a 0   means that Shift-Alt-D is not assigned
;;            the 9 must be followed by a space any letter a space and "0"
;;
;; OR just omitting Ad from the text also means it is not assigned
;;
;; 8 means that the key will be recognized as a hot key that sends a
;;   message to the program name passed on the command line
;;
;; Ad 8 b 0   assigns Shift-Alt-D as a message sending Key
;;            the 8 must be followed by a space any letter a space and "0"
;;
;; Otherwise the field has the following meaning
;;
;; 0   Allows the Shell to establish the session type - best as a rule
;; 1   Starts program as Full Screen OS/2
;; 2   Start Program in Windowed Session for programs using Base Video System
;; 3   Start Program in Windowed Session for programs using PM services
;; 4   Start Program in Full Screen DOS session
;; 7   Start Program in Windowed DOS session
;;
;; The next field is the file spec of the program to be executed and the
;; field after that is either a "0" indicating no  command line parameters
;; or the command line parameters. If the command line parameters contain
;; any spaces the command line parameters must be contained within "".
;;
;; Ae 0 c:\os2\e.exe c:config.sys ; loads the system editor included in OS/2
;;                                  to edit c:config.sys and assigns  this
;;                                  command to Shift-Alt-e
;;
;; Generically speaking the format below assigns programfilespec to Shift-Alt-x
;;
;; Ax 0 programfilespec "program command line" ;if there are command line parms
;;
;; Ax 0 programfilespec  0                     ;if no command line parms
;;
;; The  programfilespec must contain the extension .COM / .EXE / .BAT
;; BAT files can be loaded just like EXE files
;;
;; HOOKKBSM uses the DosStartSession Function of the OS/2 API to load programs.
;; It is documented on page 2-345 of the Control Program Functions Manual.
;;
;; DosStartSession does not like to load a CMD file directly so they must be
;; loaded with a command processor as
;;
;; A1 0 c:\os2\cmd.exe abcdef.cmd ; abcdef.CMD loaded by OS/2 command processor
;;
;; To assign a program to a key follow the examples/rules above
;;
;; If you edit this file while HOOKKBSM is Active, press Shft-Alt-UpArrow(W)
;; to re-read this file in and redefine the Active Set of Keys
;;
;; This file contains some assignments using programs that come with OS/2
;; as well as assigning several key combinations to both OS/2 and DOS
;; Windowed and Full Screen Sessions. You may of course change any or all
;; of these but they are included as a "starter" so to speak.
;;
;; The following keys are pre-assigned for your convenience and testing
;;
;; A1,A2,A3 to OS/2 Command Processors, Ae to OS/2 Editor e.exe
;; As to OS/2 pmseek program, At to target.exe
;; C1,C2,C3 to DOS Command Processors,Cb to Qbasic,Cw to Windows 3.1
;; Ab,Ce and Cx are assigned to send messages to TARGET.EXE
;; EVERYTHING IS CHANGEABLE
